    H7oscillo-v1 Readme
  
	Description:
	
	1) The 32F746GDISCOVERY board is used for this project without any modification.
	2) Implemented using only the STM32F7 Low-level drivers and direct register accesses.
	3) Oscilloscope Channel 1 is Arduino-connector A0, Channel 2 is Arduino-connector A1. 
	4) Single quadrature encoder is used to change various oscilloscope parameters. Data1 output of the quadrature encoder is connected to Arduino-connector D1, and Data2 		   output is connected to Arduino-connector D0. The push button output of the quadrature encoder, which is used to select a particular field for changing, is connected to 	      Arduino-connector D2.
	5) The touchscreen functionality is used to select menus, etc.
	6) The GUI for the oscilloscope is built using the ÂµGUI v0.31 embedded graphics library - https://github.com/achimdoebler/UGUI. 
	7) Uses 8 bits per sample. The oscilloscope uses a sample memory of 1.4K samples, and sample rates ranging from 48KHz to 2.22MHz depending on the time scale.
	8) The input signal voltage range is 0 - 3.3V (STM32 inbuilt ADC).
	9) Three trigger modes: Auto, Single, Normal. Sensitive on Rising, Falling or both the edges.
	10) Up to 4 measurements can be made on the waveforms at a time: frequency, duty cycle, RMS, max, min, peak-peak, average.
	11) Zoom-in/out on the captured waveform for analysis.
	12) Three channel waveform display modes: Split, Merged, Single (channel 1 only).
	13) FFT mode for spectrum analysis (480-point, 0.15 dBVrms/div).
	14) Math operations on waveforms: add, subtract, multiply.
	15) Vertical and Horizontal cursors for waveform measurement.
